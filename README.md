Dialog is a simple, opinionated, just-enough logging library that implements an
SLF4J-compatible logging backend in Clojure. This means it is compatible with a
wide variety of logging APIs, including `clojure.tools.logging`.

Inspired by the fallout from the [log4shell](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)
vulnerability, and the question "what if we wrote _just enough_ code to do the
kinds of logging we want?". This is an attempt to produce a
minimally-configurable logging backend that is nonetheless still extensible in
a few ways - in particular, it aims to be easy to integrate with
[ken](https://github.com/amperity/ken) as an extension to observability
tooling.
